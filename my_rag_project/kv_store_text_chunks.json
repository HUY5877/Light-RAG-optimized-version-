We obtained this knowledge by sampling neurons from recordings with large drift (Figure 3a) from a public repository of more than 500 Neuropixels recordings from the IBL consortium (Figure 3b).

The latest version, Kilosort4, represents our cumulative development efforts over the past eight years, containing algorithms like template deconvolution (from Kilosort1), drift correction (from Kilosort2.5), as well as completely new clustering algorithms based on graph methods. Furthermore, Kilosort4 was re-written from the ground up in Python, an open-source programming language, using the pytorch package for GPU acceleration. The popularity of pytorch/python should ensure that Kilosort continues to be further improved and developed. We have also developed a new simulation framework to improve the benchmarking of spike sorting algorithms.

The projections are binned in 400 bins linearly-spaced between $^{-2}$ and 2, and the histogram is gaussian smoothed with a standard deviation of 4 bins. To score the degree of bimodality, we find three important values in the histogram: the peak of the negative portion, the trough around 0, and the peak of the positive portion. First we find the trough $x_{m i n}$ at position $i_{m i n}$ in the bin range of 175 to 225. Then we find the peaks $x_{1}$ , $x_{2}$ in the bin ranges from 0 to $i_{m i n}$ and from $i_{m i n}$ to 400. The bimodality score is defined by",
